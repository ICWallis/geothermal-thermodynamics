## Key Dependency

Many of the recipes in this repository use the [chemicals](https://chemicals.readthedocs.io/), which is an MIT licensed open source python package. 

Users of the chemicals package should consider including the following citation:

> Caleb Bell and Contributors (2016-2021). chemicals: Chemical properties component of Chemical Engineering Design Library (ChEDL) https://github.com/CalebBell/chemicals. 

Installation of chemicals is described in [their docs](https://chemicals.readthedocs.io/index.html#installation). If you have used the requirements.txt file in this repository to build an environment, then chemicals and its dependencies are already installed.
